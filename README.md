The e-commerce platform combines modern frontend frameworks, a robust backend, and automated deployment processes.
Users can browse, search, and purchase products, while the backend handles all operations securely and efficiently.
The CI/CD pipeline ensures every update goes through testing and is deployed automatically with minimal downtime.
This reduces manual work, improves release frequency, and ensures system stability.

● This project aims to build a simple and scalable e-commerce website using Spring
Boot and Hibernate. To ensure fast and reliable updates, a CI/CD pipeline automates
testing, building, and deployment. The result is a modern, cloud-ready application that
improves both user experience and development efficiency.

● The backend handles user management, product listings, orders, and payments
through secure REST APIs, ensuring smooth e-commerce operations.

● The frontend provides the user interface for the users and the admin to access the backend and place orders, view products etc.

● Application is Dockerized which allows for reproducible builds without worrying about dependency management.

● Kubernetes running on Minikube cluster is used to create multiple instances of our frontend and backend containers.

● Automated workflows using Jenkins streamline testing, building, and deployment, minimizing manual errors and downtime.
